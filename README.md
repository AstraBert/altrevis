## What is altrevis?
altrevis (Alignment, Tree and Visualization) is an easy-to-use tool to align DNA/RNA or protein sequences, infer a ML-like phylogenetic tree from the alignment and visualize it. 

It provides a straightforward pipeline that only needs the unaligned sequences of interest in a fasta file to get to the visualization of the inferred phylogenetic tree, with near-zero effort on the side of the user.
